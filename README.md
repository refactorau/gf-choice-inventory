## Hidden Field Status (Conditionals & Notifications)

This plugin can write a per-field **status** at submission time so you can use it in conditional logic, notifications, and workflows.

### How it works

1. Add a **Hidden** field (or a Text field you keep hidden).
2. In **Field Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Parameter Name** (aka `inputName`), set: `gfci_{FIELD_ID}_status`

Where `{FIELD_ID}` is the numeric ID of the choice field that has inventory enabled.

### Possible values

- `available` ‚Äî none of the selected choices for that field were sold-out at submit time.
- `soldout` ‚Äî at least one selected choice was already sold-out at submit time (counts reflect state **before** saving the new entry).

### Example

If your ticket field has ID **7**, create a hidden field with: `gfci_7_status`

Then you can:

- Trigger **conditional logic** sections when the value is `soldout`
- Send special **admin notifications** for oversold picks

### Notes

- Works with **Radio**, **Checkbox**, and **Select** fields (including Image Choices)
- Unlimited choices always set status to `available`

üí° **Pro tip:** Combine the hidden field with Gravity Flow or notification routing to flag oversold choices and alert admins in real time.
